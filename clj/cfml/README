# cfml

This is the example project for cfmljure.

## Usage

These are just some examples to show how cfmljure works. Look in index.cfm to see how
cfmljure sets up the Clojure runtime, loads scripts and accesses functions.

## Installation

Copy the clj/ folder from the cfmljure project to your container's classpath. Install the
lein script from http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen (download the lein script, make
it executable, run lein self-install). Run the tests:

	lein clean, deps, test

You should see (with a different file path, I expect):

	Cleaning up.
	Copying 2 files to /Developer/tomcat-ws/lib/clj/cfml/lib
	Testing cfml.test.examples
	Ran 7 tests containing 7 assertions.
	0 failures, 0 errors.

Now you can copy the Clojure JARs from the clj/cfml/lib/ folder to your container's classpath
and restart your container. Now go hit the cfmljure index.cfm file in your browser!
